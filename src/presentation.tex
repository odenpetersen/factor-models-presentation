\section{Securities Markets}

\begin{frame}{Spot Transactions}
	The point of trading is to obtain an asset by giving up money, or obtain money by giving up an asset.

	If I give you $q$ units of some asset $A$, and you give me $\$p$, then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I have \textbf{sold} $q$ units of $A$ to you at $\frac{\$p}{q}$
		\item You have \textbf{bought} $q$ units of $A$ from me for $\frac{\$p}{q}$
	\end{itemize}

	Buying and selling are collectively called `trading'.

	Suppose I own some amount of $A$ and some amount of money. If we let $s$ be $+1$ for buying and $-1$ for selling, then the result of any trade is to add $qs$ to the amount of $A$ I own, and add $-qps$ to the amount of money I have. %s is called the sign of the trade

\begin{frame}{Securities Markets and Exchanges}
	The \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{market}} is the collective activity of all traders. When we don't care who we trade with, we can just `trade with the market'.

	A \textbf{\textcolor{red}{securities} \textcolor{blue}{market}} for some asset $A$, open at a time $t$, is any \textcolor{red}{standardised} \textcolor{blue}{way for traders to reach agreements to buy or sell} $A$ at a specified \textbf{settlement time} $T\geq t$. %"securities" because of standardisation and regulation

	\pause

	For example, $T=\ldots$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $t$ (`spot', e.g. blockchain) %ASX tried to do blockchain, this was scrapped in 2022 after 7yrs
		\item $t+1, t+2, \ldots$ (`clearing', e.g. equities)
		\item Last Thursday of month (`futures')
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	If you agree to give something to someone, you have an \textbf{obligation}. If someone agrees to give you something, you have a \textbf{right}.

	\begin{block}{Counterparty Risk}
		If I have an agreement with $P_1$ to buy $10$ units for $\$p_1$ at $T$, and an agreement with $P_2$ to sell $10$ units at $\$p_2$ at $T$, and no further rights/obligations, am I guaranteed to meet my obligations?
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Settlement and Clearing}
	A \textbf{securities exchange} is a centralised venue serving a securities market for \textbf{exchange participants} (e.g. ASX, NYSE, TSE, HKEX, LME). %Explain the terms "OTC", off-exchange.

			\begin{block}{Netting}
				Centralisation allows for \textbf{netting} of rights and obligations. For any settlement time $T$, I only need to keep track of the difference between money owed to and by me, and units owed to and by me.

			\begin{block}{Collateralisation}
				At certain intermediate times $t'$ ($t\leq t'\leq T$), participants may be required to physically give (`post') something to the exchange to \textbf{collateralise} their obligations.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Money (`margin') %Explain the term "futures type settlement" and "stock type settlement"
					\item Assets (`locate'/`borrow') %"Borrow" is only if you don't own the thing
				\end{enumerate}
				If an agreement made on the exchange gives you rights to money or assets, this is typically as good as posting actual money or assets.

\begin{frame}{Summary}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Trading} is swapping money and assets
		\item A \textbf{market} is whatever you use to trade
		\item A \textbf{securities market} is a standardised way to agree to trades
		\item Agreements consist of \textbf{rights} and \textbf{obligations}
		\item A \textbf{securities exchange} is a centralised trading venue %Maybe explain national market system
		\item After trades are agreed to, they will be \textbf{settled} in some standardised way
		\item Traders may be obligated to post assets ('locate') or money ('margin')

\section{Trading}
\begin{frame}{Profitability}
	A sequence of trades that collectively increases the amount of money you have and leaves the amount of each asset you have unchanged is clearly favourable.

	Suppose that at each time $t$ you have cash holdings of $\$c_t$ and net holdings of $a_t$ units of some asset $A$.

	If you make trades $(s_t,q_t,p_t)$ at times $t \in \tau = \{t_0,\ldots, t_n\}$, then we will have
	$$a_{t_1} - a_{t_0} = \sum_{t\in \tau} s_t q_t$$
	%$$c_{t_1} - c_{t_0} = \sum_{t\in\tau} - p_t s_t q_t =  \int_{t\in\tau} -p_t da_t\footnote{$da_t$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $a_t$ with respect to the counting measure of $\tau$.} \pause = p_{t_1}a_{t_1}-p_{t_0}a_{t_0}$$

	Suppose you make trades $(s_t,q_t,p_t)$ at times $t$. The change in your cash holdings $\Pi_t$ will be
	$\Pi = $
	The net change in our cash holdings as a result of a sequence of trades $ will be
	$$\Pi_{\mathcal{T}}=\sum_{\tau\in\mathcal{T}} -s_\tau q_\tau p_\tau.$$

	Consider the set of all our trades made in some time period $[0,T]$ for a particular asset. For any $t\in[0,T]$, our position $x_t$ will satisfy
	$$x_t - x_0 = \sum_{\tau : t_\tau \leq t} s_\tau q_\tau.$$
	Our cash holdings $\Pi_t$ will satisfy
	$$\Pi_t - \Pi_0 = \sum_{\tau : t_\tau \leq t} -p_\tau s_\tau q_\tau = \int_0^t p_t dx_t$$ %p_t is (our) LTP

	a db = [ab] - b da


	Consider a day's worth of trades for a single asset. I begin at time $0$ with a net position of $0$. My position at time $t$ is given by
	$$x_t = \int_0^t dx_t,$$
	where $\int_a^b dx_t$

\begin{frame}{Trade Formation}
	On an electronic exchange, trade prices are determined by participants interacting with the exchange's \textbf{matching engine}.%Explain this term

	The most common type of matching engine is a \textbf{limit-order book}, which can operate in either a \textbf{continuous} or \textbf{batched} fashion.

	\pause
	
	\begin{block}{Limit-Order Book} %Special kind of data structure. Also called a double auction
		At any point in time, market participants can create a request (`\textbf{limit order}') to trade up to $q$ units at a price $p$ (or better). %Explain 'better'
		
		They are then said to be ``\textbf{bid} for $p$'' (if requesting to buy) or ``\textbf{ask}ing at $p$'' (if requesting to sell). %Bid and ask are terms referring to limit order directionality

		All limit orders are collected into a \textbf{limit-order book}. Orders may then be \textbf{cancelled}, \textbf{modified}, or \textbf{matched}. %matching is also called a fill

		%Limit orders are options provided to other market participants

		%Explain matching
		%Explain market orders as a bid for infty or an ask at 0

	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Continuous Matching}
		% aggressive vs passive (taking/making)
		%adverse selection -> order priority. + free messages -> tick size, min size, lot size, ratelimits.
		% order priority -> latency -> colocation, fpgas.
	\end{block} %Usually used for intraday trading

	\begin{block}{Batch Matching}
